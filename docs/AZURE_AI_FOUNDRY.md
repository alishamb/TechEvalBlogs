## Exploring Azure AI Foundry’s Core Components  

### 1. Pre-Built AI Models and Services  

Azure AI Foundry simplifies AI development with its extensive library of pre-built models. These include:  
- **Text Analytics**: Sentiment analysis, language detection, and key-phrase extraction.  
- **Speech Services**: Speech-to-text and text-to-speech applications for multi-language support.  
- **Computer Vision**: Optical character recognition, object detection, and facial recognition.  
- **Decision Services**: Intelligent recommendations and process optimizations.  

### Getting Started with Text Analytics  

Here's an example of how to use Azure’s Text Analytics API:  

```csharp
using Azure.AI.TextAnalytics;
using Azure;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        string endpoint = "https://<your-resource-name>.cognitiveservices.azure.com/";
        string apiKey = "<your-api-key>";

        var client = new TextAnalyticsClient(new Uri(endpoint), new AzureKeyCredential(apiKey));

        string text = "Azure AI Foundry is revolutionizing artificial intelligence.";
        DocumentSentiment sentiment = client.AnalyzeSentiment(text);

        Console.WriteLine($"Sentiment: {sentiment.Sentiment}");
        foreach (var sentence in sentiment.Sentences)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Sentence: {sentence.Text}, Sentiment: {sentence.Sentiment}");
        }
    }
}
```

This example demonstrates sentiment analysis using Azure's Text Analytics API. Organizations can use this service to analyze customer feedback and improve satisfaction rates.

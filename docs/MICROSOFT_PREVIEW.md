## Popular Microsoft Preview Programs  

### 1. **Windows Insider Program**  
Windows Insider is a program that lets users preview upcoming releases of Windows operating systems before they become widely available. Whether you're a developer or just curious about new features, this program offers a sandbox for testing.  

#### Real-World Example:  
Imagine you're an IT administrator preparing your organization for Windows 11 updates. By joining the Windows Insider Program, you can test the latest builds in a secure environment and assess compatibility with enterprise applications.  

#### How It Works:  
- Choose from three channels: Dev Channel (latest experimental features), Beta Channel (more stable builds), or Release Preview Channel (features nearing release).  
- Download Insider updates directly through the Windows Update settings.  

#### Sample Code Snippet: Enabling Insider Mode via PowerShell  
If you're an IT Pro who loves automation, here's a handy script to set the Insider build channel:  
```powershell  
# Switch to Windows Insider Beta Channel  
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned  
Install-Module -Name WindowsUpdateProvider -Force  
Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name InsiderBuilds  
$insiderChannel = "Beta"  
Set-RegistryKey -Path "HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\WindowsSelfHost\Applicability" -Key "BranchName" -Value $insiderChannel
